<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project evaluates hotel bookings during the course of multiple years to drive strategic insights for location based inventory optimization and marketing campaigns to improve cancellation rates. 
Python was utlised for cleaning, EDA analysis and hypothesis testing, and Tableau for visualization.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Effective marketing, identification of holiday periods, and cost manipulation are critical in the hospitality sector. This project aims to explore:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Which factors influence hotel booking cancellations the most?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Do higher prices really lead to more cancellations?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Does waiting list length affect cancellation likelihood?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Which customer segments (OTA, travel agents, direct bookings) cancel more often?

5Ô∏è‚É£ How do seasonality and geography impact cancellations?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Dropped null values in 100 plus rows.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Removed unwanted columns : agent,	company.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Manipulated data to create bins for customer bookings based on waiting list - Short, Medium, Long.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Extracted month from reservation_status_date to enable visualisation generation based on month in Tableau.

- 37% of clients who cancelled their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings.
- City hotels have larger cancellation rates than Resorts.
- Average daily rate (ADR) for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel.
- Number of approved reservations is largest in the month of August, whereas January is the month with the most cancelled reservations.
- The top country was found out to be Portugal with the highest number of cancellations (appx 70%).
- Around 47.4% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 20.3% come from Offline travel agents. Only 10% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

**Outliers Identified:**

- Large ADR values for one of the bookings, skewing the o/p - Ignored for better analysis

‚úîÔ∏è Price sensitivity: Bookings with higher ADR (average daily rate) were significantly more likely to be cancelled.

‚úîÔ∏è Turns out, resorts are more expensive than city hotels, yet city hotels experienced more cancellations.

‚úîÔ∏è Waiting list myth busted: Contrary to expectation, short waitlist customers cancelled more often than those on longer waitlists‚Äîlikely because long-wait customers are more committed, while short-wait bookings are opportunistic.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="final-recommendations"></a>Final Recommendations</h2>

üîπ Refine pricing strategies‚Äîoffer competitive discounts during peak cancellation months.

üîπ Incentivize direct bookings to reduce reliance on OTAs.

üîπ Target short-wait customers with retention strategies (flexible offers, loyalty perks).

üîπ Use seasonal promotions in low months (Dec‚ÄìJan) to reduce cancellation risks.
